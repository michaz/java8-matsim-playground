D3.js enables us to compose things with dynamic interactions, like a web component and another
web component which zooms when the first web component zooms, in a single container. 
The container seems to correspond to the scope of the variables which hold the component
references as well as the behavior references: I create the web components, and I add them
to the container. I create the behavior and attach it to the web components, even though
I don't need to add it to the container.

Is NetLogo similar? Can MATSim be similar?
